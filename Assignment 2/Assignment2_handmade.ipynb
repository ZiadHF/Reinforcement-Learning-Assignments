    "To solve this, we create a **wrapper** class. This class sits \"on top\" of the original environment and modifies its behavior. The `DiscretizeActionWrapper` does the following:\n",
    "1.  It takes the continuous action space (e.g., a range from -2.0 to 2.0 for Pendulum) and converts it into a fixed number of discrete actions (e.g., 5 bins).\n",
    "2.  It tells our agent that there are now 5 possible actions.\n",
    "3.  When our agent picks a discrete action (e.g., action `2`), the wrapper translates it back into the corresponding continuous value (e.g., `0.0`) before passing it to the actual environment.\n",
